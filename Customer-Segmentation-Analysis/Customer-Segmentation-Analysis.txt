2. Considering the entire data, 54% male customers had account with the Bank. The female customers were 46%
3. With the bin of 5, most of the customers are in early 30s and late 40s. As we increase the bin size to 10, the same observaation becomes clear
4. With the bin of 10,000, there is gradual decrease in the number of customers having account in the Bank with increase in balance
5. There are about 49% white collar workers, 26% Blue collar workers and 25% in category of others for entire Bank customer data
